# Extensions, and variations of the official formula Mandel4DBiC

**The idea is simple:**   
A 4-dimensional space can be seen as two flat planes, orthogonal to each other.   
When you now take two 2d Mandelbrot sets, each living in one of the plans and put it to a fractal program then --- something interesting may be shown.   
This (and nothing else) is done by the original Mandel4DBiC.   
And indeed it is possible to get something interesting with some tricks (hybridisation).   
   
However, the formula becomes much more interesting, and easier to use if you allow to have the two Mandelbrot sets interacting with each other.    
You can get for instance filigree, and twisting threads meandring through the space - symmetrical enough to not be confusing, but irregular enough to form beautiful structures.   
The idea may sound somehow primitive - however I really like the results....
