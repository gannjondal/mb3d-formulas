# Formula files utilizing projections from, and to Riemann spheres

The original main idea was originally to map 3D to the Riemann Sphere, and then to the complex plane (by stereographic projection), do some operations, and map everything back.

## Formulas:
- **Jit_gnj_RiemannPower2_\*.m3f:**   
  The above mentioned complex operation is a calculation of the old 2D Mandelbrot 
  (just up to 3 iterations due to the limitation of JIT).   
  You can find details, and param description within the formula
