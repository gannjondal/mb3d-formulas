## Formula list:   
- **\_JIT_gnj_AddRecip_01.m3f, JIT_gnj_AddRecip_02.m3f**   
  adds a 'reciprocal' of a number to the number itself. I don't really understand the (remarkable) difference between the normal formula, and the 'Adds' version; maybe I need to check at the forums tough   
   
- **\_JIT_gnj_TSimp_Newt3_03.m3f, JIT_gnj_RealPowerPseuNewt2_02.m3f, JIT_gnj_RealPowerPseuNewt3_02.m3f**   
  Several trials to implement a Newton method.   
  The first one uses non triplex numbers; it mainly is useful for contortions.   
  Moved it to Adds to reduce noise.   
  The other two are based on triplex bulb calculation.   
  JIT_gnj_RealPowerPseuNewt2 shows better results, although it contains an error. Hence I left it in the collection.   
   
- **\_JIT_gnj_PseuLog_03.m3f**   
  Kind of pseudo-'logarithm' based on the definition of logarithm of complex numbers. Hope the people from the forums don't see that one ;-)   
   
- **JIT_gnj_TSimp_Sqr02.m3f**   
  One variant of non-triplex 3D mandelbrot implementation   
  Best to be used as cuts (it's for instance the base of 'More Classics 1')   
   
- **JIT_gnj_Tutorial1_01.m3f**   
  Just the formula used in my little tutorial   
   
- **JIT_RealPower.m3f**   
  The 'classic' mandelbulb, for learning purposes.   
  It is equivalent to RealPower.m3f   
  (of course the JIT version is a bit slower)   
   
- **JIT_gnj_RealPower_m02_01.m3f**   
  Tiny mutation of the above JIT_RealPower.m3f   
   
- **JIT_IQBulb_m01.m3f**   
  Tiny mutation of the JIT_IQ_Bulb.m3f as delivered with M3D v190
