# Tutorial on how to create JIT formulas

I had published this JIT formula tutorial for MB3D at [Deviantart](https://www.deviantart.com/gannjondal/art/Basic-Intro-Mb3D-Formula-Editor-and-JIT-Compiler-582989873)
This repository contains the tutorial's pdf, and the used/created sample JIT .m3f .
No changes are planned for now - but please feel free to ask, or comment if needed here, or at Deviantart.
